## 1) Title of Paper: 
"DNA methylation profiles of long-term cannabis users in midlife:a comprehensive evaluation of published cannabis-associated methylation markers in a representative cohort"

## 2) Metadata: 
First Author: Dr. Madeline H. Meier

## 3) Summary and Contents: 
This file contains SAS scripts and R scripts used for the above paper. The file list is below:

SAS Scripts:
- *age 38 masterfile_3.7.25* = This file tests differences between long-term cannabis users vs. lifelong cannabis/tobacco non-users on age-38 CpGs.
- *dose_robustreg_9.20.24_3.25* = This file tests dose-response associations between persistence of regular cannabis use and persistence of tobacco dependence and age-45 methylation.
- *qualgroups robust_9.20.24_3.25* = This file tests differences between qualitative groups.
- *TableS2_9.20.24* = This file creates Table S2 and estimates the correlation between test-retest reliability and effect sizes, reported in the discussion.

R Scripts: 
- *ExpressionMethylationCorrelationsMeier_etal.R* = This file contains code to create cannabis-related DNA methylation CpG-gene expression correlation matrices.
- *Circos_plots_FigureS3_Meier_etal.R* = this file contains code to create the circus plots in Figure S3.
